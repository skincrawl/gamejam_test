Development

-Improve the structure of the node tree
	-Right now the way the level is setup is confusing, with children of the level scene visible


Useability


Optimization

-Spikes in _process times
-Object pooling for the darts


Gameplay

-Random lag spikes (loading music?)
-Fan distance attenuation...?
-Fan effect area doesn't apparently always match the graphical area
-The push force isn't applied at the banana mouse in different screen sizes
-Controls are wonky, pushes way too hard when the fan is close to the monkey
-Passed checkpoints can be retriggered and update the spawn pos backwards
-When restarting, the game remembers the last checkpoint and spawns you there
-Sometimes bounces in weird angles


Level design

-Shorten the fans so they don't push you into walls


GUI

-Bubble buttons don't visually change when hovering
-There seems to be some silence in the pop audio that should be removed for the navigation to be snappy
-Bananas collected in win screen
-Main menu theme intro
-Loader to make the menu music play right away
-Menu fonts could use crayon style outlines or something


Graphics

-Particles visible outside the effect area, like even behind the fan!
-Make checkpoints visible somehow
-Change the bubble rolling animation speed depending on how fast the monkey is going


Audio

-Lag in music when navigating menus
-Dart gun sounds
-Banana collection sounds are too quiet (?)
-More yum yum sounds
-Pitch up yum yum sounds
