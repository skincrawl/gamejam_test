Gameplay

-Someone wanted the fan attenuation to be inversed, or to have the option to. So that it pushed harder from further away
-Fan works weirdly inside the bubble
-Add bananas collected in the win screen
-Add points in the win screen (deaths x time x bananas)
-Banana bunches (3 & 5)
-More bananas to safely lead the monkey down 
-Fan distance attenuation...?
-Passed checkpoints can be retriggered and update the spawn pos backwards
-Sometimes bounces in weird angles


Level design


GUI

-Bubble buttons don't visually change when hovering
-There seems to be some silence in the pop audio that should be removed for the navigation to be snappy
-Bananas collected in win screen
-Loader to make the menu music play right away
-Menu fonts could use crayon style outlines or something


Graphics

-Add a timer so Bubbles only closes his eyes after 0.5 seconds of blowing air at him!
-Particles visible outside the effect area, like even behind the fan!
-Make checkpoints visible somehow
-Change the bubble rolling animation speed depending on how fast the monkey is going


Audio

-Changing sound volume in the settings reduces it a lot
-Dart gun sounds
-Banana collection sounds are too quiet (?)
-More yum yum sounds
-Pitch up yum yum sounds


Extras

-Add a reward for collecting all bananas
-Banana fan appears in the menu after a while and you can move Bubbles around on the screen
