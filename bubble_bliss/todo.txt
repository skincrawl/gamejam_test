Technical


Export

-Find out how to export a mobile app
-Find out how to put it on a phone



Development

-Make it so pressing numbers (1, 2, 3, etc.) skips to the checkpoint with the same index in the level
	-Kinda like in youtube videos
	-Only if debug is on
-The OG level's hazards and tilemap layer are weirdly organized in the scene. Organize them better


Useability

-Add a loading screen
-Add options and back to menu buttons in the pause menu


Optimization

-Object pooling for the darts


Bugs

-The shy moon stops dropping bananas if you lose it and come back to it
-Passed checkpoints can be retriggered and update the spawn pos backwards
-The banana fan sound actually stops after a while. Make it loop
-Bubbles doesn't spawn at the spawn point after dying in test_level_4
-Bananas in test_level_2 make the game crash


Gameplay

-Someone wanted the fan attenuation to be inversed, or to have the option to. So that it pushed harder from further away
-I'd like to remove the distance attenuation
-Add bananas collected in the win screen
-Add points in the win screen (deaths x time x bananas)
-Banana bunches (3 & 5)


GUI

-Make buttons look like actual bubbles
-Add a pause menu
	-Resume
	-Settings
	-Back to menu
	-Quit
-Add a specular highlight to the bubble buttons
-Add a pop animation when pressing a button in the main menu
-Bananas collected in win screen
-Loader to make the menu music play right away
-Menu fonts could use crayon style outlines or something


Graphics

-Change it so Bubbles only rotates based on x-speed or only rotates one way
-Particles visible outside the effect area, like even behind the fan!
-Make checkpoints visible somehow
-Change the bubble rolling animation speed depending on how fast the monkey is going


Audio

-SFX are too quiet
-Dart gun sounds
-More yum yum sounds


Promo

-Cosmic fetus scene from 2001 Space Odyssey, except with Bubbles



Fun


Level objects

-Add more level objects
-Make it so the shy moon curves instead of flying straight away from monkey


Level design

-Add more curved walls


Extras

-Add a reward for collecting all bananas
-Banana fan appears in the menu after a while and you can move Bubbles around on the screen
-Make the asteroids RigidBody2D nodes so you can push them
